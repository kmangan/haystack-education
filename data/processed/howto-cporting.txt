Contents
We recommend the following resources for porting extension modules to Python 3:
•TheMigrating C extensions chapter from Supporting Python 3: An in-depth guide , a book on moving from
Python 2 to Python 3 in general, guides the reader through porting an extension module.
•ThePorting guide from the py3cproject provides opinionated suggestions with supporting code.
•TheCython andCFFI libraries offer abstractions over Python’s C API. Extensions generally need to be re-
written to use one of them, but the library then handles differences between various Python versions and
implementations.
