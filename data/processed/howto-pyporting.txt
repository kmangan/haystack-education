Python 2 reached its official end-of-life at the start of 2020. This means that no new bug reports, fixes, or changes
will be made to Python 2 - it’s no longer supported: see PEP 373 andstatus of Python versions .
If you are looking to port an extension module instead of pure Python code, please see cporting-howto.
The archived python-porting mailing list may contain some useful guidance.
Since Python 3.11 the original porting guide was discontinued. You can find the old guide in the archive .
